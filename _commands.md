You will be required to accept the license, etc, before the software will allow you to proceed, with any of these commands.

UNIX/Linux users may run these commands directly.

Cygwin/MSW users may get a suitable command-line terminal by double-clicking '_facade.bat' if 'extendedInterface' is installed.


Environment variables (ie. ollama config), bashrc hooks, etc, can be set by '_setupVirtuoso.bat' . Cygwin/MSW users should run as 'Administrator' .


Do NOT attempt to run python scripts without 'ubiquitous_bash.sh' in PATH (ie. under MSWindows without 'ubcp' Cygwin/MSW) - that is NOT supported !



```bash
./ubiquitous_bash-virtuoso.sh _fetch_local
```
