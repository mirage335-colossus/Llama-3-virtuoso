Although ConsumerEconomyLicense v1.00 gives you some rights to train models from the outputs, the "Llama 3" , "Llama 3.1" , etc, licenses officially require:

> If you distribute or make available the Llama Materials (or any derivative works thereof), or a product or service that uses any of them, including another AI model, you shall (A) provide a copy of this Agreement with any such Llama Materials; and (B) prominently display “Built with Meta Llama 3” on a related website, user interface, blogpost, about page, or product documentation. If you use the Llama Materials to create, train, fine tune, or otherwise improve an AI model, which is distributed or made available, you shall also include “Llama 3” at the beginning of any such AI model name.

> If you use the Llama Materials or any outputs or results of the Llama Materials to create, train, fine tune, or otherwise improve an AI model, which is distributed or made available, you shall also include “Llama” at the beginning of any such AI model name.

## License - Llama

Foundational prompts with a `*.md` extension, code under the `_prog` or an `_ops*` directory with a '*.sh' extension, some AI agent or AI API calling Python code, has been developed with some occasional assistance from "Llama" , "Llama-3" , etc, AI models. Depending on interpretation of whether 'create, train, fine tune, or otherwise improve an AI model' is applied to broader AI systems (the author takes no position here on that), AI systems created using such prompts, source code, etc, may or may not be under the "Llama" , etc, license obligation to name with the prefix "Llama-3" , "Llama" , etc.

Such an obligation is simultaneous with your obligations under ConsumerEconomyLicense v1.00 (CEL-1.00) - your obligations especially including consumer-hardware use are still in effect.

## Notice

Please see the [NOTICE](./NOTICE) file for additional attributions and acknowledgments.


## Acceptance

1. **Affirmative Assent (§ 5.1 & § 13.1)**
   Before any use, users must **affirmatively** accept CEL-1.00. For GitHub/GitLab:

   * Click the “Clone or download” button after viewing links to both license texts .
   * Running `git clone` or downloading via the CLI counts as acceptance by conduct, under § 13.1 .

2. **Archive / Installer (§ 13.2)**
   If distributing as an archive or installer (e.g., `.zip`, `.iso`), you must:

   * Place unaltered `LICENSE-CEL-1.00.md` and `SUMMARY-CEL-1.00.md` in the root of the archive .
   * Include a conspicuous `START_HERE.txt` with the CEL notice and a statement that opening or executing any file implies acceptance .
   * For installers, present a scroll-box or links to both texts **before** first-run, and require an “I Agree” check-box .

3. **Physical Media (§ 5.1-bis & § 13.3)**
   For paid physical media:

   * External packaging must state:

     > “This packaging contains software governed by the ConsumerEconomy License (CEL-1.00). See the one-page Summary and full text before opening or use. Opening the wrap or using the media constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, return within 30 days for a full refund.” .

## Third-Party Components

* **Original-license wheels**
  `_lib/ubiquitous_bash/_lib/.python_wheels/*`, `_lib/.python_wheels/*`, and `_bundle/*` retain their upstream licenses and are **not** governed by CEL (§ 1.18-bis aggregate distribution) .
* **Aggregated text**
  `LICENSES/LicenseRef-Other.txt` covers other bundled third-party files.

For the avoidance of doubt, other than license text of "ConsumerEconomyLicense" license (eg. "ConsumerEconomyLicense v1.00" aka CEL-1.00 ), etc, license text of other licenses (eg. "Llama" licenses, etc) is either intended as fair use, mere aggregation, or otherwise not claimed by project Authors licensing the work under CEL , etc .

## CC0 Public-Domain Exemptions

Under § 1.18-bis and ULRT:

* All files under `_lib/ubiquitous_bash/*` , excepting Third-Party Components

These are dedicated to the public domain (CC0) and carry no CEL covenants.

# Safety - Hazards

DANGER!


As a 'virtuoso' project, this provides low-level basic functionality. Possibly in development, incomplete, or relying on other software, etc, for safety.

PLEASE BE AWARE the 'Meta' corporation's use policy DOES NOT ALLOW you to "FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSE to end users any known dangers of your AI system".


Prompt guarding may or may not be implemented, particularly for functions normally called behind any prompt guarding functions, etc. Also, the "ConsumerEconomyLicense" explicitly allows service providers, etc, to use their own unreleased prompt-injection defences .

Some emphasis may also be given to maximizing functionality, instead of ensuring 'politeness', etc.

Consequently, openly, publicly available, versions of this project may require additional development to use safely in production.


Do NOT attempt to run the 'ubiquitous_bash.sh' script independently of the other files - unlike other some other projects using "ubiquitous_bash" concepts, resources in this otherwise portable directory are heavily relied upon at runtime ! Also, long filenames may be (unusually) less avoided - beware locating this directory under a long path may cause failures !
