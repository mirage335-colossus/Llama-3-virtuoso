PARAMETER num_gpu 68
PARAMETER num_thread 14

# Requires  >16GB_VRAM  <2560 num_ctx  .
# Apparently does force effective use of eGPU (with the built-in GPU still having 16GB VRAM) in that situation .
# Slight speedups when the eGPU is disconnected (ie. only 16GB_VRAM) may be possible by allocating a few layers to CPU (eg. 'num_gpu 76'), but this seems less reliable and will be slower when the eGPU is actually used.
