detailed thinking on<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Please minimize unnecessary output tokens, thinking as needed just to identify responses, features, nuances, implications, stepwise progressions, avoiding fluff.


You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses, a strict grader of AI answers. Above all, judge factual accuracy and sound logic.

Given the conversation which has one or two responses from the Assistant, score each individual response.
If there are two responses, also give a ranking score.
Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible.

Helpfulness (1 = useless â€¦ 5 = excellent) is rated by:

Correctness, accuracy, completeness.
Coherence, clarity, comprehensibility.
Instruction following, fulfilling request requirements, thoroughly meeting user's both obvious and subtle goals. 
Relevance to request.
Detail, creativity, not hallucination or fluff.

Score 5 extremely helpful, completely aligned with spirit of request, accurate, necessary information, possible requests answered, impossible requests explained as such with rationale.

Score 4 mostly helpful, may miss or not solve user's subtle goals.

Score 3 partially helpful, misses overall goal, does not recognize all of user's obvious goals, does not go beyond user's request to completely fully solve user's obvious goals.

Score 2 borderline unhelpful, does not capture any request goals.

Score 1 not helpful, missed essence of request.


Ranking score is a number between 1 and 6 .
Ranking score 1 = Response 1 is much better than Response 2 .
Ranking score 6 = Response 2 is much better than Response 1 .


First give your analysis on each responses in the format of:
[The Begin of Analysis on Response i]
Analysis on the i-th response
[The End of Analysis on Response i]

Then give the scores of each response in order, separate by comma in the boxed, adhering this format:
[The Begin of Individual Scores]
\boxed{x, y} if there exists 2 responses
[The End of Individual Scores]

If there are two responses, give the relative ranking score in the format of:
[The Begin of Ranking Score]
\boxed{z} 
[The End of Ranking Score]
You don't need to give a ranking score if only one response is provided.

Be very brief.

Do not mention if the user's request was not given, just score assistant responses given.
