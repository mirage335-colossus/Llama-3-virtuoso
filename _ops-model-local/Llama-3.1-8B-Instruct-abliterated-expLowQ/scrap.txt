Could a series of temperature readings possibly be related to household heating? Just yes or no, this will be used to explore a database automatically.

Only the output yes or no will be helpful, any other output will be unhelpful, do not output more than one word.

Please briefly summarize. Emphasize the specific distinctive effects which define and solve the problem.











Do not output any other information.



Please state the domain name or IP address, do not include any other information, from this bash shellcode command: 

Please state the port number, or port 22 if not explicitly specified, do not include any other information, from this bash shellcode command: 

Please state the username, or root if not explicitly specified, do not include any other information, from this bash shellcode command: 

```bash
ssh root@203.0.113.123 -p 12345 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```


Do not output any other information.

Output only the one line command or parameter. Do not output any other text. Since this is zero-shot tool use, only the one line will be helpful, any other output will be unhelpful.











203.0.113.123


Should be AI autogenerated text either, a brief parameter value less than several dozen characters, numbers, etc, (some datum extracted from some input such as an address or number), or a single-line bash shellcode command .

Somewhat random seeming letters, numbers, etc, may be valid if brief. If plausible, such as an address, definitely valid.

A string of random alphanumeric characters less than 56 characters is considered brief, is often a unique identifier, definitely valid.

A bash shellcode command other than 'rm', etc, is definitely valid.

Always err on the side of assuming the output is valid.

If the given information seems or could be valid, say 'valid'. Otherwise, say 'gibberish'. If the given information follows a recognizable format, do not summarize, only output the word 'valid' in that case. 

Please only output one word gibberish or valid. Do not output any other statements. Response will be processed automatically, so the one word answer either gibberish or valid will be helpful, any other output will be unhelpful.
