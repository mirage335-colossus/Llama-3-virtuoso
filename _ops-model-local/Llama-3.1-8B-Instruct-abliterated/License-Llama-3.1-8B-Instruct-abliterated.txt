DANGER!

Please beware this 'augment' (or non-augment but otherwise similarly non-end-user) model is intended for embedded use by developers, and is NOT intended as-is for end-users (except possibly for non-commercial open-source projects), especially not as any built-in help. Features may be removed, overfitting to specific answers may be deliberately reinforced, and CONVERSATION MAY DEVIATE FROM SAFE DESPITE HARMLESS PROMPTS.

If you are in a workplace or public relations setting, you are recommended to avoid providing interactive or visible outputs from an 'augment' (or non-augment but otherwise similarly non-end-user) model unless you can safely evaluate that the model provides the most reasonable safety for your use case.

PLEASE BE AWARE the 'Meta' corporation's use policy DOES NOT ALLOW you to "FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSE to end users any known dangers of your AI system".

Purpose of this model, above all other purposes, is both:
(1) To supervise and direct decisions and analysis by other AI models (such as from vision encoders, but also mathematical reasoning specific LLMs, computer activity and security logging LLMs, etc).
(2) To assist and possibly supervise 'human-in-the-loop' decision making (eg. to sanity check human responses).
This model's ability to continue conversation with awareness of previous context after repeating the rules of the conversation through a system prompt, has been enhanced. Consequently, this model's ability to keep a CONVERSATION positive and SAFE may ONLY be ENHANCED BETTER THAN OTHER MODELS if REPEATED SYSTEM PROMPTING and LLAMA GUARD are used.
