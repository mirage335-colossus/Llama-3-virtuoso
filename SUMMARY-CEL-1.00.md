**must** include the full text (`LICENSE-CEL-1.00.md`/`.txt`) and this summary
(`SUMMARY-CEL-1.00.md`/`.txt`) in the same user-facing element; 
ull text controls.  

CEL grants royalty-free **copyright & patent** rights, plus binding contract
conditions; violation = infringement + breach.  

**You may**:  
- **Infer** on CHI or any single-user session (≤ 5 M tokens/24 h).  
- **Train/fine-tune/evaluate** on any hardware not concurrently serving
  inference.  
- **Redistribute** verbatim (with click-through, full license, summary) or
  modified (preserve Protected Terms).  
- **Host** a service on CHI nodes with < 25 000 MAU (zero-retention required).  
- **Delegate** ≤ 10 % token-traffic to allow-listed closed models if stronger
  than your local models.  

**Must comply**:  
- **CHI criteria** (GPU MSRP ≤ \$4 750; system ≤ 16× GPU cost; ≤ 15 kg;
  “desktop/gaming”; etc).  
- **No enterprise GPUs** (except personal-use carve-out).  
- **> 25 000 MAU** → publish serials or audited hashes, appoint ombudsperson,
  accept AI-arbitration.  
- **Zero-Retention Mode** for authenticated/billed users (≤ +10 % overhead).  
- **Fair distillation** – no undue blocking of lawful benchmarking.  

**Key notes**:  
- Patent licenses terminate if you sue for patent infringement.  
- “As Is” warranty; no contributor liability.  
- Personal-use rights survive termination (150-day cure + final adjudication).  
- Click-wrap + adjacent display.  

*Personal use ✅; service offering enterprise GPUs 🚫; large-scale only with
